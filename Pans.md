## Is Non-Stick the Best Option?

Allow me to explain my Valentineâ€™s Day present, a stainless steel pan!

I grew up always using non-stick pans. So when we got married, it was an obvious choice to get non-stick Teflon pans, as they are easier to cook with and clean. However, upon further research I learned that Teflon may not be the best choice when attempting to minimize toxins.

PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), commonly called Teflon, is a synthetic chemical of carbon and fluorine atoms used to coat cookware. When heated to high temperatures, the chemicals in the Teflon pan can be released into the air and inhaled which can lead to "Teflon flu" with chills, fever, headache, etc. Some lung damage has been reported, as well. Even heating a pan for two - five minutes may release the chemicals. Also, the Teflon coating can begin to chip or scratch due to use and/or storage, which can lead to these chemicals being ingested.

Instead of worrying yourself with just how hot your pan is getting or if you should be concerned about chips or scrapes or even worrying about putting the pan in the dishwasher, invest in one of these safer options. - Stainless Steel: Used by all of the chefs we see on the Food Network, this durable and scratch-resistant pan is a great option.

### 1. Cast-iron

These pans are incredible durable and will last a life time, and if you season them properly, can be naturally non-stick. Remember these can only be washed with water, no soap.

### 2. Ceramic

These pans can be non-stick and easy to clean, but they are not as durable as cast-iron or stainless steel.
