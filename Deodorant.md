## Smelling Good, Naturally

Letâ€™s talk deodorant! This an easy and inexpensive product to change in your daily routine to reduce toxins. There are four main ingredients that are commonly found in deodorant that are best avoided in our bodies that I want to share. I will share some links in the comments so you can read more about these ingredients. 

### Parabens

This toxin interferes with the way the body produces hormones, and though has not been proven to lead to cancer, this toxin has been found in a majority of breast cancer patients in certain studies.

### Aluminum

Aluminum has been linked to breast cancer, and again, there is no conclusive evidence that deodorant with aluminum will lead to breast cancer, but the fact that deodorant is applied directly to the breast tissue under the arms is an alarming fact. 

### Triclosan

Triclosan is used to prevent certain bacteria as it is a pesticide. However, when put into our blood stream, it can interrupt consistent hormones production.

### Phthalates

These are nasty things! They are linked to many reproductive illnesses in men and women, ADHD, cancer, obesity, autism, and the list could go on. Get these out of your life!

### Good options

Two deodorants that I have tried that exclude these ingredients are Arm & Harmer Essentials and Native, Cucumber Mint.

Love them both! They last all day, smell nice, and feel smooth! I really love the Cucumber Mint smell, so I might pick that Native over Arm & Hammer.

Go ahead; take your first step towards a toxin free life!
